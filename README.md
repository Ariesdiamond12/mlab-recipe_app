# React + Vite

-I've created a Recipe App using ReactJS and Vite
- I've styled my recipe app using Tailwind CSS
- I've used JSON server to validate if the data that the users have entered when registering correctly corresponse with the data that will be enterd when loging in the application (username and password)
- On the home page a list of recipes will be displayed
- There is a search bar/function where users can search for recipes and an Add button where it will navigate to another page where users can add a new recipe

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
